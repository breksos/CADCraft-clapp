// The check nothing else performs: does clatch.json still describe THIS code?
//
// `clatch validate` reads the manifest, the compiler reads the code, and neither can
// tell you they disagree — which is how a manifest ends up declaring a verb the CLI
// dropped, or the CLI answering one the manifest never declared (and which therefore can
// never be granted: `connector.commands` is the permission grain, `Bash(whatsapp <name>:*)`).
// The same goes for signals: an id the app emits but does not declare is REFUSED at the
// control pipe, silently, at runtime.
//
// Pure text + JSON, no toolchain: it runs on a bare runner where `cargo build` cannot
// (clappkit is a path dependency that CI has no copy of), and it is the whole of this
// repo's CI gate until clappkit is published.
//
