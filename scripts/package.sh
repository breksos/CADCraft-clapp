# Assemble the Clatch DEPOT — the folder `clatch validate`, `clatch install` and
# `clatch pack` consume:
#
#   <depot>/clatch.json              the manifest (verbatim; cliBin gains .exe on Windows)
#   <depot>/bin/<cli>[.exe]          the ONE binary — the GUI *and* the agent CLI
#   <depot>/assets/icon.png          the icon clatch.json declares
#   <depot>/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md   when the repo has one
#   …plus whatever app_extras() adds
#
# Prints exactly ONE line on stdout — the depot path — and sends every other word to
# stderr, so this is a legal thing to write:
#
#   clatch validate "$(npm run -s package)"
#
# The script is identical in shape in every clapp: one small per-app header block,
# then a body that is byte-identical everywhere. Fix a bug once, copy it four times.

# CROSS-PLATFORM. Written for macOS, Linux, and Windows under Git Bash / MSYS2 — the
# shell Git for Windows installs, which is also what `npm` already assumes there, so
# no second implementation is needed. The Windows branches (.exe suffix, node.exe
# vendoring, the cliBin rewrite, skipping chmod) were reasoned from the platform's
# rules and from Clatch's own installer, and on 2026-09-21 they were RUN: this
# template built, packaged, validated, packed and round-tripped on a real Windows
# machine, and the binary carries no VCRUNTIME140 import. Linux is still reasoned.
