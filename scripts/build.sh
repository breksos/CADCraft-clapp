# so unlike the template (Tauri) there is no frontend to embed and no Tauri step: a cargo
# release build of the one binary that serves both roles (`cadcraft app`, `cadcraft <verb>`).
# The window embeds craft-fonts when CRAFT_FONTS_DIR points at a checkout, as CADCraft's own
# releases do; without it the window uses the system's fonts.
